THE ANSWER 

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID BETWEEN 100 AND 105 ;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID IN (151 , 152 , 153 , 154 , 155) ;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'p%'  OR  FIRST_NAME  LIKE 'P%'; 

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%A '  OR  FIRST_NAME  LIKE '%a'; 
 
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '__e%'  OR  FIRST_NAME  LIKE '__E%'; 

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE MANAGER_ID IS NULL ; 

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE MANAGER_ID IS NOT NULL ; 

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, job_id, manager_id)
VALUES (209, 'Sara', 'Hassan', 'SHASSAN', SYSDATE, 'IT_PROG', NULL);

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE JOB_ID  in('IT_PROG' , 'AD_VP'  ) ; 

SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY LAST_NAME  ; 

SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY HIRE_DATE DESC   ;

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY DEPARTMENT_ID  ASC  , SALARY DESC ; 

SELECT FIRST_NAME , EMPLOYEE_ID , JOB_ID , lower(LAST_NAME ) AS name FROM EMPLOYEES;

SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID , JOB_ID , upper(FIRST_NAME) F_N FROM EMPLOYEES;

SELECT INITCAP(first_name) AS F_N , INITCAP(last_name) AS L_N , INITCAP(first_name) || INITCAP(last_name) AS full_name  FROM EMPLOYEES; 


SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE LOWER(LAST_NAME ) = 'smith' ;
