ðŸ§  Task 1: Understand List vs Vector
ðŸ“„ Task: Compare and write the differences between List and Vector in Java.

ðŸ§© Focus:

Thread safety

Performance

Synchronization

->In Java, List is an interface representing an ordered collection of elements, 
while Vector is a concrete class implementing the List interface, 
primarily distinguished by its thread-safety and performance characteristics.

-->>Thread Safety and Synchronization:

*Vector: Vector is a legacy class where all its public methods are synchronized. 
This means that only one thread can access and modify a Vector instance at a time, 
ensuring thread-safety in a multi-threaded environment. This synchronization is inherent to the Vector class.

*List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList): The List interface itself does not guarantee thread-safety.
 Implementations like ArrayList and LinkedList are not synchronized by default.
 To achieve thread-safety with these List implementations, external synchronization mechanisms are required, 
such as using Collections.synchronizedList() to wrap the List or implementing custom locking mechanisms (e.g., synchronized blocks) around operations on the list.

Performance:
#Vector: Due to the overhead of synchronization on every method call, Vector generally exhibits lower performance compared to unsynchronized List implementations like ArrayList,
 especially in single-threaded environments or when thread-safety is not a primary concern. The constant locking and unlocking operations add a performance penalty.
#List (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList): ArrayList and LinkedList generally offer better performance in single-threaded scenarios because they do not incur the overhead of synchronization.
 ArrayList is typically faster for random access, while LinkedList excels in insertion and deletion operations in the middle of the list.
 When external synchronization is applied to a List implementation, its performance will be affected by the synchronization mechanism used.


ðŸ§  Task 2: Understand HashSet vs LinkedHashSet
ðŸ“„ Task: Compare and write the differences between HashSet and LinkedHashSet.

ðŸ§© Focus:

Order of elements. 

HashSet

Does not maintain any order of elements.

The order can change as elements are added or removed.

Example: Adding elements [10, 20, 30] may print in unpredictable order like [30, 10, 20].

LinkedHashSet

Maintains elements in the insertion order.

If you insert [10, 20, 30], iteration will always give [10, 20, 30].



Performance:

HashSet

Usually faster than LinkedHashSet because it doesnâ€™t maintain order.

Time complexity: O(1) for add, remove, and contains (on average).

LinkedHashSet

Slightly slower than HashSet because it maintains a linked list to remember insertion order.

Time complexity: still O(1) for add, remove, and contains, but with a bit of extra overhead.

Use cases:
HashSet

When you only care about unique elements and donâ€™t care about order.

Best for fast lookups and set operations (union, intersection, etc.).

LinkedHashSet

When you want unique elements but also need to preserve insertion order.

Useful for caching (e.g., least-recently-used implementations) or when order matters in iteration.





ðŸ§  Task 3: Understand String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
ðŸ“„ Task: Compare and write the differences between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer.

ðŸ§© Focus:

Mutability:
String

Immutable â†’ once created, it cannot be changed.

Any operation (e.g., concatenation) creates a new String object in memory.

StringBuilder

Mutable â†’ content can be changed without creating a new object.

Supports methods like append(), insert(), delete(), reverse().

StringBuffer

Also mutable (like StringBuilder).

Provides the same methods as StringBuilder.



Thread safety:
String

Immutable â†’ naturally thread-safe (cannot be modified after creation).

StringBuilder

Not synchronized â†’ not thread-safe.

Unsafe if multiple threads modify it at the same time.

StringBuffer

Synchronized â†’ thread-safe.

Safe for use by multiple threads, but slower due to synchronization overhead.




Performance:
String

Slower for repeated modifications (creates new objects each time).

Efficient if the value doesnâ€™t change often.

StringBuilder

Fastest for string modifications (no synchronization).

Preferred in single-threaded scenarios.

StringBuffer

Slower than StringBuilder because synchronization adds overhead.

Useful only when thread safety is required.



When to use each:
String

When the value is constant or rarely changes.

Example: storing fixed names, keys, or messages.

StringBuilder

When you need to modify strings frequently in a single-threaded context.

Example: building dynamic SQL queries, text processing, loops with concatenation.

StringBuffer

When you need to modify strings in a multi-threaded context.

Example: server-side logging, multi-threaded caching, or when multiple threads update the same string.
